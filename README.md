# ZigaRetter - The gamified cigarette bin to raise awareness and form actions on cigarette butt littering

> Cigarette butt littering is very common. About two thirds of consumed cigarettes end up in the
environment. Cigarette butts contain many hazardous or toxic substances that can harm humans,
animals underwater or on land and plants. The ZigaRetter is a micro-controller based, gamified
cigarette bin attachment, designed to tackle the lack of awareness about the negative
consequences caused by cigarette butt littering. Three stages of interaction are used to do so.
First, the ZigaRetter attracts people with gamification elements. Second, the device provides
users with facts about cigarette butt littering to raise awareness. Third, an alternative is shown
by using pocket ashtrays to fight against the improper discarding of cigarette butts in the long
term, regardless of location. The ZigaRetter targets young adults frequenting a bar where the
device should be installed. The project is open-source and all required information for
rebuilding and for further development are available in this article or the source file repository
linked.
